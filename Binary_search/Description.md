Problem Description

Task. The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛 and a sequence 𝑎0 < 𝑎1 < . . . < 𝑎𝑛−1
of 𝑛 pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. The next line contains an integer 𝑘 and 𝑘
positive integers 𝑏0, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑘−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 105; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 3 · 104; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛; 1 ≤ 𝑏𝑗 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑗 < 𝑘;

Output Format. For all 𝑖 from 0 to 𝑘 − 1, output an index 0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 such that 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑏𝑖 or −1 if there
is no such index.

Sample 1.
Input:
5 1 5 8 12 13
5 8 1 23 1 11
Output:
2 0 -1 0 -1
In this sample, we are given an increasing sequence 𝑎0 = 1, 𝑎1 = 5, 𝑎2 = 8, 𝑎3 = 12, 𝑎4 = 13 of length
five and five keys to search: 8, 1, 23, 1, 11. We see that 𝑎2 = 8 and 𝑎0 = 1, but the keys 23 and 11 do
not appear in the sequence 𝑎. For this reason, we output a sequence 2, 0,−1, 0,−1.
