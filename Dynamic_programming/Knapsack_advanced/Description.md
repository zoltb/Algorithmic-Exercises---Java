Problem Description

Task. Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊.

Input Format. The first line of the input contains the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack and the number 𝑛 of bars
of gold. The next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑤0,𝑤1, . . . ,𝑤𝑛−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑊 ≤ 104; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 300; 0 ≤ 𝑤0, . . . ,𝑤𝑛−1 ≤ 105.

Output Format. Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity 𝑊.

Sample 1.
Input:
10 3
1 4 8
Output:
9
Here, the sum of the weights of the first and the last bar is equal to 9.
